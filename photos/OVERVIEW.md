# Photos Application Overview

Our application is a photobook application where we can upload photos.  The photos will then get thumbnails created (already did that part!) and then will be sent to an object recognition service that will tag the photos with different objects that are detected in them. 

Building this is a complex mesh of microservices and functions that can work together to accomplish this.
