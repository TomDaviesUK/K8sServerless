# Helm

Helm is a package manager for kubernetes applications.  Instead of using yaml files we have an easy way to install applications.  

For serverless applications we require an object store and a mongodb database.  We could install these with yaml files and it's not so hard to do that, but helm helps us with rollback and versions, so we will spend a few minutes installing helm.
